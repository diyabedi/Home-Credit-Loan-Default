# Home-Credit-Loan-Default
The objective of this project is to explore the power of boosting methods like Gradient Boost, Extreme Gradient Boost and Light Gradient Boost. I have used the Home Credit Default Risk Dataset, where I predicted whether an applicant would repay a loan or not. This is a standard supervised classification task.
